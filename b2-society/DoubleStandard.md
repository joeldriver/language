### **Double Standard (B2 Explanation):**

A **double standard** is when different rules or expectations are applied unfairly to different people or groups in the same situation. It means one person or group is judged or treated differently compared to another, even though their circumstances are similar.

### **Examples**:
1. **In Gender Roles**:  
   - A double standard might occur when men are praised for being ambitious, but women are criticized for the same behavior.  
   - Example: "He’s called confident, but she’s called bossy for acting the same way."

2. **In Discipline**:  
   - If a teacher punishes one student for talking during class but ignores another doing the same thing, that’s a double standard.  
   - Example: "It’s unfair to let one person break the rule while punishing someone else for it."

### **Why It’s Controversial**:
Double standards often lead to inequality, unfairness, and resentment because they allow one group to have an advantage while the other is held to stricter or harsher rules.
