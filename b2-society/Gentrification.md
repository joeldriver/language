### **Gentrification (B2 English):**  
Gentrification is when a neighborhood changes as wealthier people move in, improving buildings, shops, and services, but often making the area more expensive. This can cause long-term residents, especially those with lower incomes, to move out because they can no longer afford to live there. While gentrification can bring development and safety to a community, it can also lead to the loss of its original culture and character.

**Example**:  
"Over the last decade, the old district became a hotspot for luxury apartments and cafes, a clear sign of gentrification."
