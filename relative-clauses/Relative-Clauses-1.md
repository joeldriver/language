### **1. What Are Relative Clauses?**  
A **relative clause** is a part of a sentence that gives **extra information** about a noun.  
Relative clauses usually begin with **who, which,** or **that**.  

📌 **Example:**  
- The woman **who** lives next door is very kind.  
- The book **which** I borrowed was very interesting.  
- The movie **that** we watched last night was amazing.

### **2. When to Use "Who"**  
🔹 **Use "who" for people.**  
📌 **Examples:**  
- She is the teacher **who** helped me pass the exam.  
- The man **who** called you is waiting outside.  
- My friend **who** lives in London is visiting next week.  

✅ **Tip:** "Who" replaces a **person** (subject or object) in a sentence.

### **3. When to Use "Which"**  
🔹 **Use "which" for animals and things.**  
📌 **Examples:**  
- The cake **which** I made yesterday was delicious.  
- The car **which** broke down belongs to my brother.  
- The dog **which** I adopted is very friendly.  

✅ **Tip:** "Which" replaces **an object** or **an animal** in a sentence.

### **4. When to Use "That"**  
🔹 **Use "that" for people, animals, and things in defining clauses.**  
📌 **Examples:**  
- The book **that** I am reading is very interesting.  
- The woman **that** called earlier is my boss.  
- The cat **that** you saw in the garden belongs to me.  

🚨 **Important Notes:**  
1. **"That" is used in restrictive (defining) relative clauses.**  
   - *This means the information is essential to the sentence.*  
   - **Example:** *The house that is painted blue belongs to my aunt.* (We need "that" because it tells us which house.)  
2. **"Who" and "which" can sometimes be replaced with "that" in spoken English.**  
   - **Example:** *The woman that called you is my sister.* (Instead of *who*)  
   - **Example:** *The book that I bought is amazing.* (Instead of *which*)

### **5. Defining vs. Non-Defining Relative Clauses**  
There are **two types** of relative clauses:  

🔹 **Defining Relative Clauses (Essential Information)**  
- These clauses **cannot** be removed because they give important details.  
📌 **Example:**  
  - The man **who lives next door** is a doctor.  
  - The book **that I borrowed** was very interesting.  

🔹 **Non-Defining Relative Clauses (Extra Information)**  
- These clauses **can** be removed without changing the meaning.  
- **We use commas (,) around them.**  
📌 **Example:**  
  - My sister, **who lives in Spain**, is coming to visit.  
  - The Eiffel Tower, **which is in Paris**, is very famous.  

🚨 **Key Rule:** You **cannot** use "that" in non-defining relative clauses.  
✅ **Correct:** *My laptop, which I bought last year, is very fast.*  
❌ **Incorrect:** *My laptop, that I bought last year, is very fast.*

### **6. Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them**  

❌ **Incorrect:** The dog who is barking belongs to my neighbor.  
✅ **Correct:** The dog **which/that** is barking belongs to my neighbor. (*Use "which" or "that" for animals, unless referring to them as a person.*)  

❌ **Incorrect:** The teacher which taught me English was very kind.  
✅ **Correct:** The teacher **who** taught me English was very kind. (*Use "who" for people.*)  

❌ **Incorrect:** My phone, that is very old, still works fine.  
✅ **Correct:** My phone, **which** is very old, still works fine. (*Use "which" in non-defining clauses.*)
