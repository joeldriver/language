Yes! In addition to **who, which,** and **that**, there are several other **relative pronouns** and **relative adverbs** used in relative clauses.

### **1. Complete List of Relative Pronouns**
Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses and help provide more information about a noun.

| **Relative Pronoun** | **Used For** | **Example Sentence** |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Who** | People (subject) | The woman **who** called me is my boss. |
| **Whom** | People (object) | The person **whom** you met yesterday is my cousin. |
| **Which** | Animals, things | The book **which** I borrowed was very interesting. |
| **That** | People, animals, things (defining clauses) | The house **that** I bought is very old. |
| **Whose** | Possession (people, animals, things) | She is the girl **whose** car was stolen. |

---

### **2. Relative Adverbs**
Relative adverbs introduce relative clauses that describe **time, place, or reason**.

| **Relative Adverb** | **Used For** | **Example Sentence** |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **When** | Time | I remember the day **when** we first met. |
| **Where** | Place | This is the city **where** I was born. |
| **Why** | Reason | I don't know the reason **why** she left. |

### **3. How to Use These Relative Clauses**
#### **A. "Whom" vs. "Who"**
- **Who** is used as a **subject** (it does the action).
- **Whom** is used as an **object** (it receives the action).

📌 **Examples**:  
✅ The teacher **who** helped me was very kind. *(subject: the teacher is doing the action)*  
✅ The woman **whom** I called didn’t answer. *(object: "I" am doing the action, not "whom")*  

💡 **Tip**: In modern English, "whom" is often replaced with "who" in informal speech.

---

#### **B. "Whose" for Possession**
- **Whose** is used instead of "his/her/their" to show possession.

📌 **Examples**:  
✅ The boy **whose** bike was stolen is crying.  
✅ She is the author **whose** book became a bestseller.

---

#### **C. "When" for Time**
- Used for time-related expressions.

📌 **Examples**:  
✅ I will never forget the year **when** I graduated.  
✅ Do you remember the day **when** we first met?  

💡 **Tip**: You can also say *"the day that"* or just *"the day"* in informal English.  
✅ I will never forget the year **that** I graduated.  
✅ I will never forget the year I graduated. *(This is correct and natural!)*  

---

#### **D. "Where" for Places**
- Used to refer to places.

📌 **Examples**:  
✅ This is the city **where** I was born.  
✅ The café **where** we met is now closed.  

💡 **Tip**: You can also say *"the place that"* or just *"the place"*.  
✅ The café **that** we met in is now closed.  
✅ The café we met in is now closed. *(This is correct and natural!)*  

---

#### **E. "Why" for Reasons**
- Used to explain a reason.

📌 **Examples**:  
✅ The reason **why** I left is personal.  
✅ I don’t know **why** she was upset.  

💡 **Tip**: In modern English, "why" is often **omitted**.  
✅ The reason I left is personal. *(This is correct!)*

### **4. Defining vs. Non-Defining Relative Clauses**
| **Clause Type** | **Explanation** | **Example Sentence** |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Defining** (Essential Information) | No commas, gives important details | The book **that** I borrowed was interesting. |
| **Non-Defining** (Extra Information) | Uses commas, gives extra details | My sister, **who** lives in Paris, is visiting soon. |

🚨 **Key Rule**: "That" **cannot** be used in non-defining clauses!  
✅ **Correct:** My phone, **which** is very old, still works fine.  
❌ **Incorrect:** My phone, **that** is very old, still works fine.
