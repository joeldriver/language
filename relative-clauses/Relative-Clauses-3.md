## **Defining vs. Non-Defining Relative Clauses**
### **1. Defining Relative Clauses (Essential Information)**  
- A **defining** relative clause **gives essential information** about the noun.  
- **No commas** are used.  
- **"That" can replace "who" or "which"** in defining clauses.  

📌 **Examples**:
✅ The book **that I borrowed** was very interesting. (*Defines which book—essential information*)  
✅ The woman **who called me** is my boss. (*Defines which woman—essential information*)  
✅ This is the café **where we met**. (*Defines which café—essential information*)  

💡 **Without the relative clause, the sentence loses important meaning!**  
❌ *The book was very interesting.* (*Which book? This is unclear!*)  

---

### **2. Non-Defining Relative Clauses (Extra Information)**
- A **non-defining** relative clause **adds extra information** but is **not essential** to understanding the sentence.  
- **Commas** are used to separate it from the main sentence.  
- **"That" cannot be used** in non-defining clauses.  

📌 **Examples**:  
✅ My phone, **which is very old**, still works fine. (*Extra information about my phone*)  
✅ My sister, **who lives in Paris**, is visiting soon. (*Extra information about my sister*)  
✅ The Eiffel Tower, **which is in Paris**, is a famous landmark. (*We already know what the Eiffel Tower is—this is just extra detail.*)  

💡 **If we remove the relative clause, the sentence still makes sense!**  
✅ My phone still works fine. (*The sentence still makes sense!*)  

🚨 **Common Mistake**: Using **"that"** instead of **"which"** in a non-defining clause.  
❌ *My phone, that is very old, still works fine.* (**Incorrect!**)  
✅ *My phone, which is very old, still works fine.* (**Correct!**)
